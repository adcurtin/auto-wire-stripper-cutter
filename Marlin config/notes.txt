z axis steps per mm - ?



lcd for melzi




shorter machine name - done

invert x and y endstops, so they're always homed, to fix homing - or just disable the endstops? and disable homing direction - done






todo:

allow Z to move past endstop a little? - how? MANUAL_[XYZ]_HOME_POS - try more - 1.6 good
longer z axis - try 90mm? try 110 then dial it back , trying 140â€¦ 135 good





check out babystepping? for live adjust z

    etrudeded 100mm, got 105mm. changed to 95mm   



more extruder speed
    try with gcode hooked up to computer
    increased manual feedrate




test running gcode from SD
